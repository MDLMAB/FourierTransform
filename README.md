# **Fourier Transform Learning Journey** 📊  

Welcome to my **Deep Learning** repository! 🐒  

This repository serves as a documentation of my personal journey in mastering the **Fourier Transform**, a foundational mathematical tool widely used in engineering, data science, and signal processing.
---

## **Overview** 🌟  

The **Fourier Transform** is a powerful technique that allows us to analyze signals in the frequency domain, revealing how complex signals can be decomposed into simpler sinusoidal components. It has a wide range of applications in fields such as:

- **Signal Processing**: Filtering, compression, and noise reduction.  
- **Data Analysis**: Spectral analysis of time series data.  
- **Image Processing**: Compression techniques (e.g., JPEG) and feature extraction.  
- **Control Systems**: Stability and frequency response analysis.  
- **Audio and Speech**: Equalization, synthesis, and noise cancellation.  

This repository contains structured **notes, tools, and experiments** that I develop as I progress in my studies.

## **Current Status** 🚧  

I have started my learning journey with resources like a course on **Udemy**. The focus is currently on building a solid theoretical foundation and gradually moving into practical applications using tools like **Python** and libraries such as:  

- **NumPy**: For numerical analysis.  
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing signals and frequency components.  
- **SciPy**: For advanced signal processing tasks.
